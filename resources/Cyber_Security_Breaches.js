The protected health information involved included names, addresses, dates of birth, and social security numbers. Although Mercer concluded that the lost tape was configured so that even a sophisticated user would be unlikely to be able to access the data within, both Mercer and Idaho Power notified all possible affected individuals and offered free credit protection services. To prevent a similar breach from occurring in the future, Mercer now stores backup tapes through a third party vendor who offers secure transport services. Mercer's Boise office now encrypts backup tapes. Following the incident, Idaho Power renegotiated its contract with Mercer and continues to evaluate its business relationship with Mercer.",

    "Summary": "Data breach results in $4.8 million HIPAA settlements\n\nTwo health care organizations have agreed to settle charges that they potentially violated the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy and Security Rules by failing to secure thousands of patients' electronic protected health information (ePHI) held on their network. The monetary payments of $4,800,000 include the largest HIPAA settlement to date.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office for Civil Rights (OCR) initiated its investigation of New York and Presbyterian Hospital (NYP) and Columbia University (CU) following their submission of a joint breach report, dated September 27, 2010, regarding the disclosure of the ePHI of 6,800 individuals, including patient status, vital signs, medications, and laboratory results. \n\nNYP and CU are separate covered entities that participate in a joint arrangement in which CU faculty members serve as attending physicians at NYP. The entities generally refer to their affiliation as 'New York Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center.'  NYP and CU operate a shared data network and a shared network firewall that is administered by employees of both entities. The shared network links to NYP patient information systems containing ePHI.\n\nThe investigation revealed that the breach was caused when a physician employed by CU who developed applications for both NYP and CU attempted to deactivate a personally-owned computer server on the network containing NYP patient ePHI. Because of a lack of technical safeguards, deactivation of the server resulted in ePHI being accessible on internet search engines. The entities learned of the breach after receiving a complaint by an individual who found the ePHI of the individual's deceased partner, a former patient of NYP, on the internet.\n\nIn addition to the impermissible disclosure of ePHI on the internet, OCR's investigation found that neither NYP nor CU made efforts prior to the breach to assure that the server was secure and that it contained appropriate software protections. Moreover, OCR determined that neither entity had conducted an accurate and thorough risk analysis that identified all systems that access NYP ePHI. As a result, neither entity had developed an adequate risk management plan that addressed the potential threats and hazards to the security of ePHI. Lastly, NYP failed to implement appropriate policies and procedures for authorizing access to its databases and failed to comply with its own policies on information access management.\n\n'When entities participate in joint compliance arrangements, they share the burden of addressing the risks to protected health information,'  said Christina Heide, Acting Deputy Director of Health Information Privacy for OCR. 'Our cases against NYP and CU should remind health care organizations of the need to make data security central to how they manage their information systems.' \n\nNYP has paid OCR a monetary settlement of $3,300,000 and CU $1,500,000, with both entities agreeing to a substantive corrective action plan, which includes undertaking a risk analysis, developing a risk management plan, revising policies and procedures, training staff, and providing progress reports.",

The types of ePHI involved in the breach were demographic and clinical information, including diagnoses and other treatment data.  Following the breach, the CE hired a third party vendor to resolve a data crash and to create a data back-up plan in order to restore office functioning.  To implement adequate safeguards, the CE also employed a cloud service with increased security as the new network server.  Additionally, the CE contacted the local FBI office to assist with the CE's internal investigation of the breach and provided breach notification to all affected individuals, the media, and HHS.  As a result of OCR's investigation, the CE developed and implemented new protocols to comply with the Security Rule.  In addition, the CE provided and initiated new trainings for its staff, completed hiring of a new network vendor, implemented a new electronic health records system, and accounted for the disclosures in the affected individuals' medical records.",

    "Summary": "OCR opened an investigation of the covered entity (CE), Preferred Health Partners f/k/a Central Brooklyn Medical Group, after it reported appointment schedules, pathology reports and portions of medical records containing the protected health information (PHI) of 500 individuals were stolen from an office.  The PHI included names, ages, telephone numbers, social security numbers, medical insurance information, pathology reports, and other clinical information.  Upon discovery of the breach, the CE filed a police report and worked with law enforcement authorities to recover as much of the PHI as possible that was stolen.  As a result of OCR's investigation, the CE removed PHI such as social security or medical insurance numbers from tracking logs.  In addition, the CE improved safeguards by storing log binders in a locked area and shredding documents regularly.  Further, the CE replaced the manual process of printing certain records with an electronic verification system.  The CE also archived, stored off site, and locked up all paper records and retrained all staff on its HIPAA policies and procedures.",

Upon discovery of the breach, the CE, Monmouth Medical Center, filed a police report, provided breach notification to HHS, the media, and affected individuals, and posted substitute notification on its website.  As a result of OCR's investigation, the BA retrained the employee, instructed all employees to stop using any type of external storage device that contains ePHI, and recalled and destroyed all unencrypted external hard drives that contained ePHI.  In addition, the BA improved technical safeguards by encrypting external hard drives and installing a new software system that monitors, controls and encrypts data leaving the BA's computers.  The BA also hired an IT security analyst to supplement its security program.  The breach incident involved a BA and occurred prior to the September 23, 2013, compliance date.

The ePHI included names, dates of birth, social security number, account numbers, medical record numbers, charges incurred, amounts paid, admission and discharge dates, and information regarding health insurance and eligibility for applicable governmental benefit programs.  Upon discovery of the breach, the CE, Clara Maass Medical Center, filed a police report, provided breach notification to HHS, the media, and affected individuals, and posted substitute notification on its website.  As a result of OCR's investigation, the BA retrained the employee, instructed all employees to stop using any type of external storage device that contains ePHI, and recalled and destroyed all unencrypted external hard drives that contained ePHI.  In addition, the BA improved technical safeguards by encrypting external hard drives and installing a new software system that monitors, controls and encrypts data leaving the BA's computers.  The BA also hired an IT security analyst to supplement its security program.  The breach incident involved a BA and occurred prior to the September 23, 2013, compliance date.

The box contained the protected health information (PHI) of 2,239 individuals and included names, dates of birth, dates of surgery, surgeon names, procedures, and types and serial numbers of the tissues used in the surgeries.  Upon discovery of the breach, the CE contacted the waste disposal contractor and determined that the documents were discarded and buried in a landfill out of state.  The CE provided breach notification to HHS, the media, and affected individuals, and posted substitute notice on its website.  As a result of OCR's investigation, the CE improved safeguards by storing all tissue records in a locked cabinet and requiring management to store the keys.  In addition, the CE counseled the employees involved in the incident and retrained all staff on its policies and procedures for safeguarding PHI.  The CE also implemented a plan to conduct reviews of HIPAA compliance, including both physical access and physical security risks.",

The ePHI included social security numbers, driver's license numbers, and other demographic information, as well as bank account information of fourteen individuals and credit card information of three individuals.  Upon discovering the breach, the CE filed a police report and hired a private investigator to recover the stolen items.  The CE also initiated plans to encrypt laptops, revise security procedures, retrain employees, and offer credit monitoring to affected individuals.  As a result of OCR's investigation, the CE completed a security risk analysis and risk management report and implemented new security policies and procedures to ensure adequate safeguards to protect ePHI.  The CE also provided media notification in the two localities with greater than 500 individuals affected.  Additionally, the CE encrypted all employee computers and removable media containing ePHI and retrained employees on the CE's confidentiality and security policies.",

Following the breach, the CE reported the theft to the building management company.  The management company investigated the theft and determined that cleaning personnel had stolen the laptop.  The company reported that the patient information was not compromised, as the database could not be accessed without propriety software and specialized assistance. As a result of OCR's investigation, physical security was improved by housing the replacement laptop in a locked drawer in a locked office with limited staff access.  The CE also implemented a new policy prohibiting the storage of PHI on the laptop computer and updated additional policies and procedures to enhance safeguards for systems containing PHI.",

    "Summary": "The CE's network server and two local computers were hacked and compromised by a computer virus which resulted in the disclosure of electronic protected health information (ePHI) of 6,745 individuals.  The ePHI included names, insurance numbers, diagnoses, medical histories, dates of birth, telephone numbers, and social security numbers.  Upon discovery of the breach, the CE shut down all computer and email systems to prevent unauthorized access to its network and core files.  In addition, the CE decommissioned the previously used server, deactivated the network router, disabled network access to ePHI, and discontinued the previously utilized backup.  As a result of OCR's investigation, the CE deployed a new real-time firewall and intrusion detection system and implemented new measures for software management.  In addition, the CE installed a new network server, deployed a new router with security subscription to actively monitor internal network traffic and external threat patterns, and implemented a centralized antivirus software system.",

In addition, the medical education organization posted the presentation slides on its website.  The graph contained the protected health information (PHI) of 569 individuals and included names, telephone numbers, social security numbers, ages, cities and states of residence, medical record numbers, and clinical information.  Upon discovery of the breach, the CE ensured that the information was removed from the website and deleted, sanctioned the workforce member responsible, and retrained its workforce on the use of a data loss prevention tool and the risks of embedded PHI.  As a result of OCR's investigation, the CE provided OCR with evidence of its technical safeguards and security awareness initiatives and provided assurance that it implemented the corrective action listed above.",

    "Summary": "An employee's personal laptop computer that contained the unencrypted electronic protected health information (ePHI) of 3,183 individuals was stolen from his vehicle.  The ePHI involved in the breach included consumer names, identification numbers, diagnosis codes,  base service unit numbers, service start and end dates, service names, procedure codes, service location identifiers, units authorized, units utilized, units cost, total authorization amounts, total utilized amounts, authorization dates, funding sources, provider names, and master provider index numbers.  The CE timely notified all affected individuals, the media, and HHS, and offered assistance to consumers who wished to place fraud alerts on their consumer credit files.  Following the breach, the CE created and implemented a new policy and procedure to improve safeguards.  This policy prohibits downloading any PHI to a home computer or portable device, prohibits forwarding emails containing PHI to a personal account, cloud service, or unauthorized user, and requires full-disk encryption of agency laptops.  OCR obtained assurances that the CE implemented the corrective action listed above.",

The CE provided breach notification to HHS, the media, and affected individuals, and posted substitute notice on its website.  Upon discovery of the breach, the CE suspended its mailing in order to verify subscriber information to ensure pending and completed projects did not contain social security numbers.  As a result of OCR's investigation, the CE modified its mailing procedures to prevent similar disclosures from recurring in the future and retrained staff on its modified mailing procedure.  The CE provided affected individuals with a free one year subscription for credit monitoring.",

The PHI included names, member identification numbers, and social security numbers.  The CE provided breach notification to HHS and affected individuals.  Upon discovery of the breach, the BA contacted the U.S. Post Office to inquire about the package that contained the invoices that the CE never received.  As a result of OCR's investigation, the BA revised its invoice process and removed social security numbers and member identification numbers from its invoices.  The BA also improved safeguards by changing its mailing procedures to send invoices to the CE via secure email.  The breach involved a BA and occurred prior to the September 23, 2013, compliance date.  OCR verified that the CE had a proper BA agreement in place that restricted the BA's use and disclosure of PHI and required the BA to safeguard all PHI.",

Upon discovery of the breach, the CE engaged a computer forensic expert to investigate the incident and terminated the BA agreement.  As a result of OCR's investigation, the CE ensured that its BA secured the server, verified that the server was no longer accessible from the Internet, and required the BA to return or destroy all of the CE's ePHI.",

    "Summary": "OCR opened an investigation of the covered entity (CE), John J. Pershing VA Medical Center, after the CE reported that its business associate (BA), Stress Laboratory, placed a box of unsecured protected health information (PHI) in an equipment storage room.  The PHI included the names, social security numbers, diagnoses, and age of approximately 589 individuals.  This breach incident involved a BA, and occurred prior to the September 23, 2013 compliance date.  The BA employee involved in this matter separated from employment in 2012, and the BA was reorganized and has been incorporated into the CE.  The CE provided breach notification to affected individuals, HHS, and the media.  Substitute notification was provided through a posting on the CE's main website with a toll-free information number.  The CE also offered one year of identity protection and credit monitoring services to affected individuals.  As a result of this incident, the CE adopted a new policy that provides guidance to its staff regarding the handling of PHI.  Additionally, the CE trained its employees on this new policy, and re-trained its employees on the Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules.  Finally, OCR obtained assurances that the CE implemented the corrective action listed above.",
